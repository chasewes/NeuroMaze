# NeuroMaze: A Deep Learning-Driven Maze Game

## Introduction
NeuroMaze is a project that reimagines game development through the lens of deep learning. It leverages a convolutional LSTM model to predict game dynamics, creating a new paradigm where a model essentially becomes the game engine. This project uses a simple 2D maze game as a proof of concept, demonstrating how deep learning can predict the next frame in a game based on the current frame and player input.



## How It Works
NeuroMaze uses a convolutional LSTM architecture designed for next-frame prediction. It takes a 32x32 image of the current game state (the maze) and the player's action (up, down, left, or right) as input. The model then predicts the next frame, essentially deciding the new position of the player in the maze and updating the game state accordingly. This process mimics the core functionality of a traditional game engine but is driven entirely by the deep learning model.

### Technical Highlights:
- **Data Generation**: The dataste was generated on a python maze game autonomously played through randomly generated mazes, saving the frame, action, and resulting frame data for training. (10,000 frames were saved for training)
- **Model Training**: The model is trained on a dataset comprising both correct and incorrect moves to understand the game's dynamics fully.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Integrated into a web app, the model runs in real-time on a CPU, allowing players to interact with the maze directly.

## Shortcomings and Future Work
While NeuroMaze successfully demonstrates the potential of deep learning in game development, it's not without limitations. The current necessity to develop the game initially for data generation is a redundancy that future advancements might eliminate. The project also faces challenges in consistently predicting certain game elements, like the player's position.

Future work includes:
- **Expanding to More Complex Games**: Applying the model to games with more dynamic elements and interactions.
- **Enhancing Model Performance**: Continuously improving the model's accuracy and efficiency.
- **Exploring Stable Diffusion Models**: Investigating more advanced models that could understand broader game mechanics.

## Conclusion
NeuroMaze stands as a testament to the potential of deep learning in creating interactive environments. It's a step towards a future where game engines might operate on a fundamentally different paradigm, driven by the predictive power of AI.
